# ManyATrueBot Rewrite: Changelog

## Changes
### New Code
ManyATrueBot has been rebuilt from scratch, ~~by copy/pasting code from Nerd³ Bot~~ using _machine learning_ and _algorithms_ with _blockchain_ to build The Perfect Bot™.

But, for the more technical folk, ManyATrueBot is now based on [Liara-Docker](https://gitlab.com/nerd3-servers/liara-docker), which uses [Liara](https://github.com/Thessia/Liara) as a base with Docker on top to easily extend the bot's capabilities to however I like in a way that works for me.

What this means is a bot that's easy to maintain and update with features that play nicely with each other. Hopefully.

### New Help Command
The help command has had a much needed facelift, and while it [still can't help with your homework or cooking](https://github.com/nerdcubed-community/gists/blob/master/nerd3bot/CHANGELOG.md#new-help-command), it can help teach you how to use all the fancy commands. _You have the power._

### User Info Command
`!userinfo` has a different look and supports all of that newfangled Rich Presence stuff that everyone likes.

### Quotes
Sick and tired of spamming **#support** with all your quotes? Boy, do I have the command for you!

By using the `!quote submit` command, you can submit your quote suggestions to us for review, along with a link to the source video.

Now we can finally purge **#support** once and for all because...

### `!contact` is now a thing
As if ManyATrueBot couldn't be any more of a clone of Nerd³ Bot, we now have `!contact`, `!suggestion`, `!question` and `!complaint`. Have a question regarding the Discord? Have a suggestion on how we can improve our server? Need to just talk to all the staff in private? These commands should help.

Do note that this isn't a replacement for **@Discord Staff** pings, so if there's something in a channel that needs our urgent attention then do use that instead.

Also, and I cannot stress this enough, **these commands are not a means to message Jon or Claire. Keep things related to the Discord only.**

Cool? Cool.

### YouTube Alerts work (again)
Thomas breathes a sigh of relief, as the bot is now capable of posting videos again. It's all YouTube's fault, I swear.

### Magical Voice Text Channels
Okay, so for some bizzare reason Discord will add video to voice channels before they'll add text chat, so people without mics, people wanting to share a link to other voice participants and more were kinda stuck to just sending things to a shared text channel. Kinda annoying. **UNTIL TODAY.**

Now the bot will create text channels for any voice channel as needed. This means that only voice participants (and mods) will see the contents of said channel. Not only that, but the bot will even tell you who has joined or left your channel. How handy is that?!?

Think this feature is swell and want it on your own server? Well, [it's even available as a standalone bot!](https://gitlab.com/DerpyChap/mute)

_It's not that difficult, Discord. Come on, now._

## To-Do
### Livestream Alerts
Livestream notifications are a real pain in the backside to test on YouTube, so that'll have to wait until I can properly test the feature enough to make sure it doesn't break or anything.

### `!names`
Turns out there's an interesting bug with how the `discord.py` library rewrite handles users updating their usernames that causes issues with this command. Kinda annoying, but oh well.

---
## R.I.P
Alas, not all features have made the cut. We must bid farewell to the fallen:

### Music
The old bot was kinda terrible at playing back music (Although you can't blame me for that one). So, because it broke a lot, hardly anyone used it, the development time it will take to rewrite it, copyright concerns and, most importantly, *because I don't want to*, the Music Bot functions will not be returning.

### Trivia
Another Red feature not making the cut. I feel like most people have lost interest in this one since the trivia lists were never updated, and are just kinda a headache to update too. 

Also, some people find it to be a bit spammy since it basically takes over anything else in the channel.

### Polls
This one is going too, I'm afraid. Polls felt more like a gimmick than something actually useful, and sites lke [Straw Poll](https://www.strawpoll.me/) are much more suited for actual polls. Maybe it'll return in the future?

No, it's not that, either.
